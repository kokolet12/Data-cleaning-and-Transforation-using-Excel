# Introduction
This database was formulated by me for the sake of data cleaning for I have been trying to practice my data cleaning skills.
## Problem Statement
-	How to get staff salaries that are >$15000 with indications
-	How to separate the first name from the full name and indicate where there are duplicates then rejoin them
-	How to indicate salaries according to their range of salaries
## Data sourcing
Not till I sourced for these questions before I went head to create this data on Excel which contains three sheets
## Data cleaning
-	I was able to use the sort and filter to sort the salary >$15000 with indications according to the levels.
-	I had to highlight the entire name column then clicked on text to column then clicked the space tab then I clicked the text tab and ok tab
-	I used the find tab to locate the duplicated names
-	I used conditional formatting then colour slides to differentiate the salary ranges
## conclusion
I will say that, data cleaning is very important so as to avoid duplicated data and also to make it easier for visualization.
